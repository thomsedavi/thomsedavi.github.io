      <h3>Project 1: Lego head finder</p>
      <p>Have you ever wanted to source a specific Lego head, for example one with an eyepatch and stubble, but didn't want to
      search through the 1,000+ Lego heads in the database? This tool should make it easier for you.</p>
      <p>Start by iterating over a list in JS. Not super exciting.
      <br>Also not working. My attempt to learn AngularJS from
      Codecademy has failed D:<br>
      Will try looking elsewhere to figure out what's wrong.</p>

      <h3>Project 2: Learn a language by teaching a robot language.</p>
      <p>Rather more ambitious! A kind of reverse language learning idea, where you learn by teaching. A robot will ask,
      'what's the French word for <i>Car</i>', for example, and you do the research yourself. Later on you quiz the robot
      and correct it when it suggests that <i>Papillon</i> means <i>Car</i>. Like I said, ambitious.</p>
