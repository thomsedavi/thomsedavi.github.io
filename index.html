    <h2>Project 1: Lego head finder</p>
    <p>Have you ever wanted to source a specific Lego head, for example one with an eyepatch and stubble, but didn't want to
    search through the 1,000+ Lego heads in the database? This tool should make it easier for you.</p>

    <h2>Project 2: Learn a language by teaching a robot language.</p>
    <p>Rather more ambitious! A kind of reverse language learning idea, where you learn by teaching. A robot will ask,
    'what's the French word for <i>Car</i>', for example, and you do the research yourself. Later on you quiz the robot
    and correct it when it suggests that <i>Papillon</i> means <i>Car</i>. Like I said, ambitious.</p>
