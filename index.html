      <h1>David's Projects</h1>
      <h3>An &uuml;ber-basic static website for me to list all (all!) the projects I want to work on, with estimated
        time and difficulty ratings, and how motivated I am to work on them? Just a page for me to record my thoughts,
        really.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class = "project">
      <h3>Project: This page!</h3>
      <p>It would be nice for this page to one day be more than just basic HTML?</p>
      <div class = "difficulty"><p>Difficulty: However complicated I feel like making it (currently, not much,
        obviously)
      </p></div>
      <div class = "time"><p>Time required: See above</p></div>
      <div class = "motivation"><p>Motivation: Have other priorities right now, but when I want to play with a new web
        design tool I'll do it here? (Recently tried Node.js but it doesn't run on GitHub pages :( )</p></div>
    </div>
    <div class = "project">
      <h3>Project: Lego head finder</h3>
      <p>Have you ever wanted to source a specific Lego head, for example one with an eyepatch and stubble, but didn't
        want to search through the 1,000+ Lego heads in the database? This tool should make it easier for you.</p>
      <div class = "difficulty"><p>Difficulty: Easy? University project level difficulty</p></div>
      <div class = "time"><p>Time required: Once the project had been set up, it would require a lot of time to
        catalogue every single lego head ever, and then maintain that database with new heads :(</p></div>
      <div class = "motivation"><p>Motivation: The Lego community seems to get on okay without this particular tool?
      </p></div>
    </div>
    <div class = "project">
      <h3>Project: Learn a language by teaching a robot language.</h3>
      <p>Rather more ambitious! A kind of reverse language learning idea, where you learn by teaching. A robot will ask,
        'what's the French word for <i>Car</i>', for example, and you do the research yourself. Later on you quiz the
        robot and correct it when it suggests that <i>Papillon</i> means <i>Car</i>. Like I said, ambitious, especially
        if you tried teaching it grammar as well...</p>
      <div class = "difficulty"><p>Difficulty: Potentially super difficult</p></div>
      <div class = "time"><p>Time required: Could be very quick to begin with, but slowly descend into a spiral of
        madness.</p></div>
      <div class = "motivation"><p>Motivation: I think this would be a great tool for me, but would it have any value
        to other people?
